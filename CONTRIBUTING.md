# Contributing

Hello, so you want to write code for rusty-os?, we're glad to hear that. Here are the
guidelines you need to follow in order to get your code into this repo.

## Writing Code

For writing code, you can start by looking at our (issues)[github.com/roemvaar/rusty-os/issues]
and choose that one that suits your interests better, or in case you want to propose
a feature or report a bug, do it in the same channel by first making sure you're not
duplicating the issues.

After that, open a branch with the *username/feature-name* format, e.g. *roemvaar/scheduler*
and develop your code.

Once your code is working correctly, i.e. compiles, executes correctly and passes the tests,
open a Pull Request (PR).
